# TheSecret-ary

This is a web-scraper I built to look into the concepts of data leakage. 
How much data is there on the internet about you? 
I recommend you check it out.
Kindly do not run this on anyone other than yourself.

I recommend running the software on yourself.
Then take a look at your facebook and linkedin privacy settings and change them!
If you're not convinced you should then try downloading the data that google and facebook has on you 

Google

Facebook
https://www.facebook.com/dyi
You'll find a link to download your data at the bottom of the page

### I am not licensing this software to anyone for any purpose whatsoever other than to understand the extent of their data leakage by running it on himself/herself. I am not responsible for actions of anyone using it.

But here's what you need if you want to use it.
1. A facebook and a linkedin account (an anonymous one preferably, should not be your friend/connection)
2. A mongodb atlas database key
